3.6.0.1     16-Dec-2012 John
Changed math.h to work with Eagle 5 or 6. Updated math.ulp to perform more tests on math.h to ensure conversions work correctly.

Removed progress menu options in pcb-gcode-setup.ulp, as no one uses them, and it can confuse new users.

Changed Isolation|Default label to Minimum. Globally changed DEFAULT_ISOLATE variable to ISO_MIN.

Added a drill sub for the examples/04151_lcdi2c.drl file so it wouldn't complain about the 0.086in drill.
Added name of drill rack file to drill not found message in drill.h.

Added a Single pass option. Maximum and Step size labels are changed to "not used" when Single pass is on.

The path to pcb-gcode is no longer required to be the first entry in Eagle's Control Panel | Options | Directories. Should save some new users some trouble.
